Target
According to Statista, Generation Z accounts for 20.66% of the total population in the United States. But Gen Z only accounts for 8% of books that are read in 2020. During the pandemic new paradigm, it has been surveyed 35 % of Generation Z read more than pre pandemic. As a result, a total of 55% of Gen Z now read every week.
As for 2023, based on the data that 67% of Gen Z read books through their cell phones. The way that Gen Z discovers new books is through social media or internet search. Thus, our model recommends books to Gen Z to discover new books and experience new genres, providing a platform to be interested in books and to read more.

Current Barriers, Competitors
Book-review-related applications are widely available on the market. Amazon has a huge selection of books. Users can get both paper and digital books through the Amazon apps and its kindle system. The Goodreads app allows users to recommend books based on genres, track their reading process, and interact with friends. Google Play Books provides users with ebooks and audiobooks and users can read books on multiple devices.
Book.next’s main feature is to provide universal and personalized recommendations like other book apps. But it will be an outstanding application among its competitors:
1. Book.next is totally ads free. Users can enjoy a clean reading environment without interruption.
2. The reviews from users are up-to-date with Integrity. Our recommendation on review won’t be impacted by the third-party.
3. For our target market - Generation Z - we can maintain a weekly/monthly/yearly book list of the most popular titles.
